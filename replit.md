### Recent Changes (August 2025)
- **TEST USER SYSTEM (August 19, 2025)**: Created 10 test accounts with activated cards and custom balances ranging from $420 to $3000. All test users have referral earnings and activated virtual cards to demonstrate full platform functionality. Special balance handling for ethiocapitalx@gmail.com ($1742) and Test001-010@gmail.com accounts.
- **CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES (August 19, 2025)**: Fixed major security vulnerability where any user could view any order without authentication. Implemented mandatory authentication for all order status checks, added user ownership verification for orders, and secured all order-related endpoints with proper firebaseUid validation.
- **Enhanced Real-time Balance System**: Fixed balance display issues for all special accounts (ethiocapitalx@gmail.com + Test001-010@gmail.com), implemented real-time balance updates every 5 seconds, added manual refresh functionality with loading indicators, and fixed TanStack Query compatibility issues (cacheTime â†’ gcTime). Resolved API response mapping issue where calculated referral data was overriding correct database values.
- **Protected Order System**: All order pages now require authentication, order status checking validates user ownership, URL-based order access requires verification tokens, and proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts.
- **Enhanced Withdrawal System**: Added USDT and USDC support with TRC20, ERC20, and BSC networks. Updated database schema to include currency field, implemented network-specific minimum withdrawal amounts, and enhanced admin interface for better withdrawal management.
- **Comprehensive Referral System Implementation**: Built complete referral system where rewards are only paid after card activation. Users receive unique referral codes after registration, referral records track pending/paid status, and admin verification automatically processes referral rewards ($30 for virtual cards, $45 for physical cards).
- **Streamlined Admin Verification Process**: Completely restructured the admin workflow so that payment verification automatically activates cards and processes referral rewards in a single action. Removed separate card activation step for improved efficiency.
- **Withdrawal System Consolidation**: Removed standalone withdrawal page and integrated all withdrawal functionality into the dashboard. Set uniform $100 minimum withdrawal amount for all cryptocurrencies. Withdrawal is now accessible only through the dashboard for better user experience.
- **Referral System Security & Balance Updates**: Implemented card activation verification before showing referral codes/links. No demo referral codes are provided - users must activate their SpendX Card first to unlock their paid referral system. Auto-fill functionality for referral codes in signup page works via URL parameters. Proper balance tracking for paid referrals with correct "Paid Balance" and "Total Paid" statistics display.
- **Database Schema Updates**: Added referral tracking fields (cardType, orderId, paidAt) to referrals table, updated related interfaces and API endpoints to support referral reward processing with proper activation verification.
