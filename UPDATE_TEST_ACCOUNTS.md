# Manual Firebase UID Update System

## Current Status
All test accounts are ready and just need your real Firebase UIDs:

**Test Accounts Ready for UID Update:**

- Test002@gmail.com → $980 balance, 32 referrals, $1050 earnings  
- Test003@gmail.com → $720 balance, 28 referrals, $900 earnings

- Test007@gmail.com → $1100 balance, 46 referrals, $1500 earnings
- Test008@gmail.com → $900 balance, 38 referrals, $1200 earnings
- Test009@gmail.com → $420 balance, 17 referrals, $550 earnings

## How to Provide Firebase UIDs

**Option 1: Give me Firebase UIDs directly**
```
Test001: your_firebase_uid_here
Test002: your_firebase_uid_here
Test003: your_firebase_uid_here
...etc
```

**Option 2: I can auto-detect when you login**
Just login with any Firebase account and tell me which test account it should be (Test001, Test002, etc.)

**Option 3: Use existing working accounts**
- test010@gmail.com (already works)
- ethiocapitalx@gmail.com (already works)

## What Happens After UID Update
1. Account gets custom balance immediately
2. Card automatically activates for referral access
3. All referral earnings and statistics apply
4. Real-time balance updates work perfectly
5. Referral system processes new earnings correctly
